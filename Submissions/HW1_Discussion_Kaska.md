# **Discussion**

**1. What are boundary conditions?  Answer this both conceptually and mathematically.**

   Boundary conditions are what constrain a situation and this could set the stage for something to happen within. Mathematically a boundary condition is a problem you are asked to solve within a set domain. 

**2. What are model parameters?  How do they (and don't they) represent the actual subsurface?**

   Model parameters are mathematically set domains. They could prepresent the actual subsurface if we were using real data collected from an area. On the other hand, model parameters don't represent the actual subsurface if we were just creating and coming up with data, like in a simulation. That is just my guess. 

**3. What are steady state conditions and how can they be identified from the Excel model results?**

   Steady state conditions are where the model or the system has the same input and the same output. It also means that the input minus the output is equal to zero. They can be identified in the excel model from the flux. If it is a steady state, our flux should be the same throughout the column. 

**4. Can you imagine how the model inputs could be stored in separate files rather than other spreadsheet cells?  Describe the flow of information from a file that describes the other files that contain model-specific information about the system.**
   
Yes I can imagine how the model inputs could be stored in separate files rather than the excel spreadsheet cells. I am unsure of what exactly you are trying to ask me here. If you meant how to describe a file and its contents, you would first start with the file name. After the file name, then the item in the file you want to open, it could be any type of file it could also be a folder. If it is a folder then you just repeat the steps. If you meant coding then you would type the path from where your file came from. You could also write a code telling the system what you want to do with the file or to call files from some other place. 

**5. What is an iterative solution?  Can you explain it to a hydrologist who is not a modeler?  Can you describe (or imagine) how Excel finds the solution?**
   
An iterative solution is one that depends on the solution before it. You have several repeating steps that happen before you get a final solution. It is like counting how many apples you've had everyday, since January 1. You need to know how many apples you ate in all the days before today to figure out how many apples you had so far. I imagine that excel uses equations and codes to get this done. 

**6. What is a direct solution?  What are its (dis)advantages compared to an iterative (numerical) solution?**

A direct solution is one that give you an answer for the entire system once. The disadvatage is that you don't know what happened in the times in between. With an iterative solution you get to see the solutions that lead up to the final calculation.
