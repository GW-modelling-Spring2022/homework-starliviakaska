# **Discussion**

1. What are boundary conditions?  Answer this both conceptually and mathematically.
1. What are model parameters?  How do they (and don't they) represent the actual subsurface?
1. What are steady state conditions and how can they be identified from the Excel model results?
1. Can you imagine how the model inputs could be stored in separate files rather than other spreadsheet cells?  Describe the flow of information from a file that describes the other files that contain model-specific information about the system.
1. What is an iterative solution?  Can you explain it to a hydrologist who is not a modeler?  Can you describe (or imagine) how Excel finds the solution?
1. What is a direct solution?  What are its (dis)advantages compared to an iterative (numerical) solution?
