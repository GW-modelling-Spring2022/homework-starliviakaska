**1.** Show, based on the flux with depth, that the model is steady state. Repeat this for a homogeneous and for a heterogeneous column. 

**2.** Show that the steady state flux agrees witht he direct calculation based ont he harmonic mean average K. Write the equation defining the direct calculation of the flux. 

**3.** Show the steady state head profile for a columsn with appproximately equal-thickness layers that have different K values. 

**4.** Use the head profile rto explain WHY the equvalent Hydraulic conductivity, Keq, is closer tot he lower of the two K values.
